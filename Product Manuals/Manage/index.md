# FastScore Manage

The FastScore Manage leverages your existing source code management best practices and tooling, enabling natural and rapid deployment of model assets.

As a supporting microservice for the FastScore Engine, manage provides the engine with access to name-based execution assets, including models, data schemas and data stream descriptors. Manage leverages existing repositories and processes in the enterprise integration allows for natural and rapid adoption. Once Manage is in place, teams naturally adopt model repositories that control access by role and model lifecycle stage - creating a seamless path for MDLC adoption and enforcement.
